🏡 House Price Prediction
This project aims to predict house prices based on various features such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, parking spaces, and additional amenities. Using machine learning, we train a regression model on historical real estate data to estimate property prices accurately.

🔹 Dataset: The model is trained on a dataset containing house attributes and their corresponding prices.
🔹 Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Streamlit (for deployment).
🔹 Goal: Provide an intelligent pricing system that helps buyers and sellers make informed decisions.
